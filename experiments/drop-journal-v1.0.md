_Memorable Artifacts_

In thinking about the artifact(s) Ping Practice could inspire and empower you to make, new language surfaced for what I notice myself needing. I sense the questions that follow could eventually inform the "shape" of these yet-to-be-named artifacts...

1. _Might I be more present and accepting of how I’m feeling if I can easily reference the "features" of the present moment  (e.g. responsibilities, interactions, choices, etc.)  that have been impacting me?_
2. _Might I be able to more effectively embody an intention if it’s related to a defined/bounded phase/period of time?_&#x20;
3. _Might I feel more grounded and present if I can easily reference intentions, events, phases, etc. i’ve ascribed names to?_

_Memorable Artifacts_

Ping Practice is meant to help you become clear about what's meaningful to you and make that meaning memorable enough to embody.

Although, as [Alex](https://www.alexhollender.info/), [Jeff](https://jnoh.net/), and [Laurel](https://laurelschwulst.com/) have identified, it's not yet clear to what extent – if any – Ping Practice (the app/tool) offers the affordances people need to be inspired and equipped to compile/create/converge on these meaningful artifacts.

I think it's important to arrive at a clear opinion on the above – regardless of what that opinion is – because I think these artifacts are fundamental to addressing the [core needs](https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/needs) Ping Practice is an effort to meet.&#x20;

This topic feels quite big to me. To start, I'm thinking I'll review the meaningful and memorable Pings I've created over time.

_Notable Pings_

Every so often, [a Ping will emerge that feels distinct from other Pings](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. I know I'm encountering a Ping of this sort when its emergence causes a flood of other Pings to surface or collect within it. Sometimes, these Pings have the effect of making movement clear in a context that I'd previously felt stuck within.&#x20;

_In my mind is the image of a natural dam giving way and with it, water flowing freely through – what had previously been – a constricted waterway._

Last night, a Ping of this sort surfaced, _"I'm creating from a place. I'm not creating to get to a place."_ This Ping, combined with a series of Pings before it, [summed into me becoming unblocke](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]d and clear and how I might go about nurturing a creative practice in a way that harmonizes with being present as a new father.

Beyond these Pings' power to unblock and generate new thoughts, they tend to be durable, relevant to the broader context/place[^3] I find myself within. In hindsight, these Pings also tend to be memorable. They can quickly bring me back into the moment they served me within...they can demarcate time.

The power and durability of these Pings leads me to wonder:

1. _How – if at all – might the interface inspire you to converge on "notable" Pings?_
2. _Where – if at all – might the interface afford space for "notable" Pings to gather?_

_Revisiting_&#x20;

* Revisting: consistently experiencing instinct to "go back"; current ability to explore feels limited&#x20;
* Artifacts: neding affordance(s) to inspire me to create intentions&#x20;
* _Look back through "meta" pings_
