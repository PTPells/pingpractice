_Notable Pings_

Every so often, [a Ping will emerge that feels distinct from other Pings](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. I know I'm encountering a Ping of this sort when its emergence causes a flood of other Pings to surface or collect within it. Sometimes, these Pings have the effect of making movement clear in a context that I'd previously felt stuck within.&#x20;

_In my mind is the image of a natural dam giving way and with it, water flowing freely through – what had previously been – a constricted waterway._

Last night, a Ping of this sort surfaced, "I'm creating _from_ a place. I'm not creating _to_ get to a place." This Ping, combined with a series of Pings before it, [summed into me becoming unblocke](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]d and clear and how I might go about nurturing a creative practice (Ping Practice) in a way that harmonizes with  the reality of being a new father.

Beyond these Pings' power to unblock and generate new thoughts, they tend to be durable, relevant to the broader context/place[^3] I find myself within. In hindsight, these Pings also tend to be memorable. They can quickly bring me back into the moment they served me within...they can demarcate time.

The power and durability of these Pings leads me to wonder:

1. _How – if at all – might the interface inspire you to converge on "notable" Pings?_
2. _Where – if at all – might the interface afford space for "notable" Pings to gather?_

_Revisiting_&#x20;

* Revisting: consistently experiencing instinct to "go back"; current ability to explore feels limited&#x20;
* Artifacts: neding affordance(s) to inspire me to create intentions&#x20;
* _Look back through "meta" pings_
