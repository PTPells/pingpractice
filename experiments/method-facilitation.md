# Method Facilitation

{% hint style="info" %}
This experiment started on 7 April 2023.
{% endhint %}

To date, [I](../about.md)[ have been](../about.md) the main research subject [on a quest](../need-memory.md) to remember what I learn and believe in the fleeting moments where I sense opportunities to apply them.

This experiment marks the first time other people will be experimenting with [the method](../method.md) with me by using [the improvised capture and revisiting workflows.](drop-journal-v0.1.md)

## Research questions&#x20;

This experiment is an effort to answer the following research questions:

1. _Does the_ [_journaling method_](../method.md) _reliably lead people to developing a practice of unblocking themselves?_
2. _How might the method, and the way it's communicated, be improved to increase the likelihood that people develop a practice of unblocking themselves?_

## Impact & Conclusions

{% hint style="info" %}
_Conclusions will be documented once experiment concludes._
{% endhint %}

## Experiment Design

What follows is an outline of how I've structured this initial experiment. &#x20;

The initial cohort of experimenters included six people, five of which were familiar with, and in some cases, contributing to this project prior to the experiment beginning.

Everyone, regardless of how familiar they were with this project, has been doing the following:

1. Using Broadcast + Twitter to name (read: ascribe language to) moments when they notice themselves stuck or moved
2. Using Airtable or Notion) to revisit the what they are naming
3. Meeting with [me](../about.md) a few times to reflect on what they're noticing

Each phase of the experiment is meant to guide people through, what I currently understand to be, the four key moments of the method:

1. **Name** moments when you notice yourself stuck or moved
2. **Revisit** what you've named to explore and elaborate on what speaks to you
3. **Create** cues and prompts your future self can call on to unblock yourself
4. **Make self-supporting choices**

To provide some orientation as experimenters go about doing the above, each has sketched out a few outcomes they would feel energized about realizing by thee end of the four week experiment.
