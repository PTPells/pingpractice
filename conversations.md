# Conversations

At various moments throughout this "project," ideas, hypotheses, designs will congeal into a form that _**appear**_ simultaneously:

1. Stable and solid enough to build upon&#x20;
2. Definitive and clear enough for&#x20;

## [phase-1.md](phase-1.md "mention")

Between August 2021 and August 2022, I talked with \~30 people who I knew to be intentional and creative.&#x20;

I was motivated to develop a sense for whether the [need I had noticed](need-memory.md) was a need other people experienced as well. This way, we ([David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I) could gauge the [the solution's ](app.md)potential appeal and decide whether the need was a stable/durable enough reference point to orient the design of the app around.
