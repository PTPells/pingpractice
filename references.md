> If we examine the feelings that accompany daily life, we find that historic monuments occupy a small place.&#x20;

> To attempt to preserve all of the past would be life-denying.&#x20;

> There must also be some random accumulations to enable us to discover unexpected relationships. But serendipity is possible only when recollection is essentially a holding fast to what is meaningful and a release of what is not.&#x20;

> Choosing a past helps us to construct a future. If forms are standard and do not change, we experience déjà vu. The world recycles endlessly. Pervasive novelty is even more disturbing. We experience jamais vu - we see nothing we have ever seen before, there are no connections, the present is perilously small.

> Memory is the result of a process of selection and of organizing what is selected so that it is within reach in expectable situations.
