description: Experimenting with new ways to revisit Pings

# Experiment/Twitter Pt. 2

{% hint style="info" %}
This experiment started on 10 April 2023.
{% endhint %}

The [Twitter experiment](experiment-twitter-pt.-1.md) proved successful in so far as the behavior it was intended to help me evaluate ‚Äì [noticing and naming Pings](method.md) ‚Äì [stuck](experiment-twitter-pt.-1.md#impact-and-conclusions). At the time of writing (23 April 2023), I've jotted down 2,300+ Pings and I continue doing so most days.

[Motived to experiment](experiment-twitter-pt.-1.md#impact-and-conclusions) with ways to simulate the serendipitous revisiting and discovery [the app describes](app.md) and prompted by a conversation with [Prateek](https://prtksxna.com/), this experiment is an effort to prototype a distinct place I can go to revisit and discover past Pings.\

#### Marking a thread as active

I find myself needing some extra support as I move into creating public doorways into this project (I'm thinking about a conversational video format to start. E.g. TikTok or Instagram Reels).

To provide that support, I'm going to experiment with doing the following:

1. Creating a thread to "host" / "hold" the conversation about this voice I find myself wanting to use
2. Marking this thread as üü¢`Active` so that it's easy for me to revisit.
3. Associating a picture with this thread so that it's more memorable and easier for me to arrive into the mindset it's asking me to.
4. Using Airtable's native Commenting feature to hold any thoughts that may emerge in the future. _Note: this one feels notable in so far as it's the first time I'm branching out from Twitter as the sold mode of composing._

#### Prompting / Scripting

Right: 04.30.md note within <a href="experiment-dailynotes.md">DailyNotes</a>.</p></figcaption></figure>

I jotted down ‚Äì what felt like ‚Äì a bunch of thoughts in my Drop Journal this past week. On Sunday (30 April), I sat down at my computer to try to make some sense of them ahead of the week I'm currently in.

To ready myself for this sensemaking, I created a view of what I'd dropped in my journal over the past seven days and brought up the `04.30.md` note within my [DailyNotes](experiment-dailynotes.md) alongside it. Raw material and a surface to sort through it.

In doing the above, I was wanting to revisit the specific things I'd been thinking about. More specifically, I was wanting to arrive back in the headspace those thoughts emerged within. Seeing everything together in a moment where I felt like I had the space and energy to think was wonderful.

Reflecting on the above brought me back to what Obi shared during the [first set of conversations](conversations/phase-2.md). Obi shared that when he arrives in the studio for a recording session, he'll often pull up his Apple Notes to review what he's been thinking about to see if anything there inspires/moves him to make music to.

The connection I'm drawing here between the experience I had on Sunday and the experience Obi shared with me some months ago feels fresh and notable to me. I think it's because I'm starting to see a more visceral connections between these contexts/applications: improvisation and bringing together/readying the "raw material" to do so.

#### Improv

The reflection/observation above is leading me to see a potential way through the blockage I've felt posting more publicly...

What if I act like Obi does:&#x20;

1. Book "studio sessions" for myself. As in: I'll commit to making something to share at a specific time and place for some bounded period of time.
2. In the time between each "improve sessions" I'll log all the ideas that surface to me in a consistent place.
3. When I arrive at the "studio" I'll "swipe through" the ideas that I've accrued through "2." and act on one that speaks to me.

#### Pinned

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-27 at 12.29.03 PM.png" alt="A screenshot showing a new view within the Airtable database I set up that shows &#x22;Pings&#x22; I&#x27;ve pinned."><figcaption><p>Using the new "üìçPinned" view for the first time.</p></figcaption></figure>

I'm starting to use the "Pin" field I set up yesterday which in turn inspired me to add an image today. Cool!

_Aside: I wonder if it might be interesting to call ‚Äì what I'd previosuly been referring to as "Favorites" ‚Äì simply "Active"...at least by default. Keep it simple, generic, and uncomplicated by people bringing existing meaning and expectation(s) to the word._

### 26 April

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 10.48.17 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Added a "Pin" field that I'm thinking I can use to mark and quickly return to thoughts I want to more easily revisit.

### 24 April

#### Dashboard

Woah!&#x20;

Now that I've got this dashboard set up, I'm immediately curious to see how - if at all ‚Äì this view provides me a lens through which to look at, and engage with, this Ping Practice.



#### Adding meaning to "Favoriting"

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Ping database dashboard.png" alt="A screenshot of the placeholder &#x22;Dashboard interface&#x22; that Airtable makes available."><figcaption><p>Airtable's "Dashboard" interface builder.</p></figcaption></figure>

Discovering that Airtable makes it possible to associate an image with a record (or in this context, a Ping), is helping me to imagine a new potential choice to consider when revisiting: looking out for Pings that feel especially resonant so that I can consider elevating them in some way (e.g. associating an image, or other types of media) to deepen/enhance/extend the meaning/message of the Ping and my ability to remember that meaning/message.

_Note: the above was prompted by me experimenting with setting up a "Dashboard" for the base I set up in Airtable. In doing so, I thought "Oh, it might be interesting to visualize how many Pings I've 'Favorited'."_

### 12 April

#### Search

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Just now, I was [saying something in @pingpractice](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1646205350817955843?s=20). In the process, I noticed myself making a choice _not_ to use a possessive pronoun.  In making this choice, I thought to myself, "Oh this would be a good convention/pattern to name in the ["Personal syntax" are.na channel](https://www.are.na/peter-pelberg/personal-syntax) I started."

Next, I opened up are.na and I started [drafting this block](https://www.are.na/block/21361463) to describe/bring shape to this convention. A few moments in, I noticed myself getting stuck, not locating the words I felt like I needed to express the idea that prompted me to visit are.na in the first place.

_"Hmm, what to do now?"_ I thought and then realized, _"Oh, I've "pinged" (trying out this language) about this before."_

I then went to Notion to search for `pronoun` which quickly returned what I've said in the past about possessive pronouns and ultimately helped me arrive at the language I needed!

Before Monday, I would've gone directly to Twitter to attempt the search above which  past experiences have led me to doubt whether that search would return the Tweets I'm fairly certain existed.

### 11 April

#### Day/time lens/filter

![Screenshot showing the advance filter option Notion offers when accessing a database on the iOS app.](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)![A screenshot showing all of the pings I've posted on a particular day of the week. In this case, Wednesday.](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

I finished [this past Monday (10 April) feeling](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1645606642724261888?s=20) similar to how I remember myself [feeling the Monday before (3 April)](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1643057038199787520).

This led me to experience, and subsequently [develop a bit more conviction around](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1645606642724261888), the utility of  [the app](app.md) offering people an easy way to see what they've said on days/time that are similar to the moments they currently find themselves to be in and/or curious about.

In response, I created a new view within Notion that enables me to easily [see what I've said "on this day" across time](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

[^1]: Observations and updates

[^2]: Ideally, the app will automatically know what day it is and surface relevant thoughts accordingly. Although, with this current set up in Notion, I'm still needing to manually input what day(s) of the week I'd like to see thoughts from.
