# About

hi! I’m Peter. I work as a product manager at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/).&#x20;

There, I help build software people use to make [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Wikipedias) accurate and exhaustive.

Writing is a tool I depend on to process what I’m thinking, develop ideas, name what I’m noticing, and, more broadly, learn and evolve in the roles I play: collaborator, spouse, colleague, product manager, friend, godfather, son, brother, uncle, neighbor, etc.

In 2017, motivated to become more effective at identifying patterns in what I thought about and reacted to, I [started an experiment](experiment-dailynotes.md).&#x20;

Unbeknownst to me at the time, [this first experiment](experiment-dailynotes.md) marked the beginning of an ongoing practice of experimenting with ways to become more effective at developing insights that help me evolve in the roles I play and contexts I exist within.

Until now, I’ve kept these experiments to myself. Ping Practice is an effort to this experimenting and learning legible enough for my future self to build on.
