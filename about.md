# About

hi! I’m Peter. I work as a product manager at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/).&#x20;

There, I help build the [core editing and communication experiences](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Core\_Experiences) volunteers use to make [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Wikipedias) accurate and exhaustive.

Journaling is a tool I depend on to process what I’m thinking, develop ideas, name what I’m noticing, and, more broadly, learn and evolve in the roles I play: collaborator, spouse, colleague, product manager, friend, godfather, son, brother, uncle, neighbor, etc.

In 2017, motivated to become more effective at identifying patterns in what I thought about and reacted to, I [started an experiment](experiments/dailynotes.md).&#x20;

Unbeknownst to me at the time, [this first experiment](experiments/dailynotes.md) marked the beginning of an ongoing practice of experimenting with ways to translate everyday experiences into insights and actions that align with what I think I need and value.

Until now, I’ve kept these experiments to myself. This place is a way to make what I'm learning legible enough for my future self to build on. It also serves as a reference, an anchor...a "place" I can leave from, come back to, and use to orient when I feel "far away."
