# About

hi! I’m Peter. I work as a product manager at the Wikimedia Foundation.&#x20;

There, I help build the core editing software volunteers use to make the 300 language Wikipedias accurate and exhaustive.

Writing is a tool I depend on to process what I’m thinking, explore ideas, name what I’m noticing, and, more broadly, learn and evolve in the roles I play: collaborator, spouse, colleague, product manager, friend, godfather, son, brother, uncle, neighbor, etc.

In 2017, motivated to become more effective at identifying patterns in what I thought about and reacted to, I started an experiment.&#x20;

Unbeknownst to me at the time, "running" this first experiment marked the beginning of an ongoing practice of experimenting with different ways of  working with information.\
\
Until now, I’ve kept these experiments to myself. Ping Practice is an effort to make all of the experimenting and learning I’m doing legible enough for my future self to build on.
