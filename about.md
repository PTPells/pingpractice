# About

hi! I’m Peter. I work as a product manager at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/).&#x20;

There, I help build software people use to make [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Wikipedias) accurate and exhaustive.

Writing is a tool I depend on to process what I’m thinking, explore ideas, name what I’m noticing, and, more broadly, learn and evolve in the roles I play: collaborator, spouse, colleague, product manager, friend, godfather, son, brother, uncle, neighbor, etc.

In 2017, motivated to become more effective at identifying patterns in what I thought about and reacted to, I started an experiment.&#x20;

Unbeknownst to me at the time, "running" this first experiment marked the beginning of an ongoing practice of experimenting with ways to become more effective at identifying and acting on the patterns in what I think about.\
\
Until now, I’ve kept these experiments to myself. Ping Practice is an effort to make all of the experimenting and learning I’m doing legible enough for my future self to build on.
