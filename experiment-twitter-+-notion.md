Just now, I was [saying something in @pingpractice](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1646205350817955843?s=20). In the process, I noticed myself making a choice _not_ to use a possessive pronoun.  In making this choice, I thought to myself, "Oh this would be a good convention/pattern to name in the ["Personal syntax" are.na channel](https://www.are.na/peter-pelberg/personal-syntax) I started."

Next, I opened up are.na and I started [drafting this block](https://www.are.na/block/21361463) to describe/bring shape to this convention. A few moments in, I noticed myself getting stuck, not locating the words I felt like I needed to express the idea that prompted me to visit are.na in the first place.

_"Hmm, what to do now?"_ I thought and then realized, _"Oh, I've "pinged" (trying out this language) about this before."_

I then went to Notion to search for `pronoun` which quickly returned what I've said in the past about possessive pronouns and ultimately helped me arrive at the langauge I needed!

Before Monday, I would've gone directly to Twitter to attempt the search above which  past experiences have led me to doubt whether that search would return the Tweets I'm fairly certain existed.
