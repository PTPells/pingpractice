Just now, I was [saying something in @pingpractice](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1646205350817955843?s=20). In the process, I noticed myself making a choice _not_ to use a possessive pronoun.  In making this choice, I thought to myself, "Oh this would be a good convention/pattern to name in the ["Personal syntax" are.na channel](https://www.are.na/peter-pelberg/personal-syntax) I started."

Next, I opened up are.na and I started [drafting this block](https://www.are.na/block/21361463) to describe/bring shape to this convention. A few moments in, I noticed myself getting stuck, not locating the words I felt like I needed to express the idea that prompted me to visit are.na in the first place.

_"Hmm, what to do now?"_ I thought and then realized, _"Oh, I've "pinged" (trying out this language) about this before."_

I then went to Notion to search for `pronoun` which quickly returned what I've said in the past about possessive pronouns and ultimately helped me arrive at the language I needed!

Before Monday, I would've gone directly to Twitter to attempt the search above which  past experiences have led me to doubt whether that search would return the Tweets I'm fairly certain existed.

I finished [this past Monday (10 April) feeling](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1645606642724261888?s=20) similar to how I remember myself [feeling the Monday before (3 April)](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1643057038199787520).

This led me to experience, and subsequently [develop a bit more conviction around](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1645606642724261888), the utility of  [the app](app.md) offering people an easy way to see what they've said on days/time that are similar to the moments they currently find themselves to be in and/or curious about.

In response, I created a new view within Notion that enables me to easily [see what I've said "on this day" across time](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

[^1]: Ideally, the app will automatically know what day it is and surface relevant thoughts accordingly. Although, with this current set up in Notion, I'm still needing to manually input what day(s) of the week I'd like to see thoughts from.
