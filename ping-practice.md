# Ping Practice

Ping Practice is a method I've converged on for making meaning and use of what I notice.

Where "meaning" could take the form of a:

* Pattern that helps scattered thoughts snap into place&#x20;
* Solution to a challenge you're sitting with
* Need that might explain a pattern of behavior&#x20;
* Idea that you want to make
* Value that is important to you&#x20;
* Question that helps you focus&#x20;
* Reframe to get unstuck&#x20;
* New choice to consider&#x20;
* Affirmation that empowers you&#x20;
* Reminder that helps you stay on track&#x20;
* Title for a project youâ€™re working on
* etc.

Ping Practice is built on the assumption that tiny, everyday moments are clues and pathways to deeper meaning.













&#x20;taking consistent note of tiny bits of resonance, locating them in a place you feel drawn to revisit, and empowered to expand, relate, and iterate upon these bits of resonance will compound into new meaning and insight.
