hi and welcome! I‚Äôm Peter.&#x20;

Ping Practice is a place for me to experiment with ways to become more effective at developing insights that help me evolve in the roles I play and contexts I exist within.

## Stream

_Observations and loose thoughts._

<details>

<summary>31 October 2022</summary>

I have gotten into a habit of prefixing some things I say to myself (and other people in certain contexts) with a term bounded by square brackets. So, things like:`[question]`, `[prompt]`, `[idea]`, `[ask]` etc.

And I'd like to draw a quick sketch for why I think this might be the case:

1. **Stability/Durability.** Questions, prompts, ideas, etc. are relatively stable and distinct concepts/categories of thoughts in my mind. Experience has demonstrated to me that my current and future selves are likely to have a shared understanding for what does and does not qualify as a question, prompt, idea, etc. \
   \
   In this way, using a tag as stable as \[`question]` makes it possible for me to easily assemble a set of related thoughts across time. This helps make answering big, and generative, questions like _"What have I been wondering about over the past few weeks?"_ or _"What might I write about it? Why don't I see what `[writing ideas]` I've thought about in the past couple of weeks"_ pretty easy to ask and answer.
2. **Applicability.** Questions, prompts, and ideas, have clear use cases in my life. In this way, being able to more easily locate them across the various tools where I accrue them creates a great deal of possibility for me.
3. **Legibility.**  Just like the presence of a question mark (`?`) makes it clear to people what a thought is seeking, prefixing a thought with bracketed thought type - I think ‚Äì makes it easier for people to understand what it is a particular thought is trying to say to them.

For context, I felt compelled to write all of this after noticing myself using the `[prompt]` construct in a new context: within a "Book Note" for _Thought As A System_. \
\
I think I considered this notable because seeing myself using this pattern in a new context without thinking about led me to think something like, "Huh, this pattern seems become useful enough to be something I'm "bringing with me" wherever I "go."

_Aside: I'm reluctant to categorize the above as "tags" per se, but I think that's just because I have negative associations with a particular implementation of tags which I appreciate to be a far more open-ended concept. Maybe it would be worthwhile to talk about tags some more  and why I think the implementations I've seen have done little to guide me to use them in ways that make it easier for my future selves to find what they are looking for later. Think: topical and the moments tools often present people with the opportunities to apply them._

### Directing pings

I think it would be neat if the tool could support me sending pings (_see below)_ to the tools I'd like to act on them within.&#x20;

The above leads me to wonder whether there's something to this idea of being able to create some kind of "meta" area around the workspaces I frequent. _Thinking: these workspaces would become more generative and richer and the ideas within them would become stronger because of my increased ability to remember them and thus an increase in the frequency with which I am "interacting" with them._

### Fun

Wow. This place feels great to be in...I'm having fun ^ \_ ^ Thank you for the metaphor, Laurel!

### "Stream" Purpose

I think I'm going to constrain this stream to thoughts related to thoughts related to working with information.&#x20;

The above had been pretty much implicit in my mind, but sometimes I find it helpful to explicitly say or write out things out to reinforce them.

### "Where should I put this?"

In the moment just before arriving here, I was feeling excited as I thought about all of the things I wanted to talked about from today.

Now, I'm here. I'm not writing in DailyNotes, I'm not writing in Twitter, I'm not in Messages, and I'm not drafting an email. I could see each of the topics I was wanting to write about being a fit for these different places, but I couldn't see a single place where they'd all fit.

That little question ‚Äì _"Where should I put this?"_ ‚Äì was enough to interrupt the flow I felt. I think that's all what I'm wanting to name for now: the blocking force of this choice and the ease with which it can resurface.

### Synthesizing&#x20;

I think writing out loose thoughts has helped me to become more effective at spontaneously synthesizing what I'm thinking in feeling in conversations, meetings, etc.

In this way, I think I'm starting to feel more confident in my ability to improvise.
