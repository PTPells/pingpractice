hi and welcome! Iâ€™m Peter ^ \_ ^&#x20;

Ping Practice is a place where I experiment with strategies to help me become more effective at unblocking myself and becoming clear about what's meaningful to me.

Read more [about me](about.md), [get in touch](mailto:peter@pelberg.com), or read about the [experiment that helped started all of this](experiments/dailynotes.md).
