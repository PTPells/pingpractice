hi and welcome! I‚Äôm Peter.&#x20;

Ping Practice is a place for me to experiment with ways to become more effective at developing insights that help me evolve in the roles I play and contexts I exist within.

#### "Where should I put this?"

In the moment just before arriving here, I was feeling excited as I thought about all of the things I wanted to talked about from today.

Now, I'm here. I'm not writing in DailyNotes, I'm not writing in Twitter, I'm not in Messages, and I'm not drafting an email. I could see each of the topics I was wanting to write about being a fit for these different places, but I couldn't see a single place where they'd all fit.

That little question ‚Äì _"Where should I put this?"_ ‚Äì was enough to interrupt the flow I felt. I think that's all what I'm wanting to name for now: the blocking force of this choice and the ease with which it can resurface.

#### Synthesizing&#x20;

I think writing out loose thoughts has helped me to become more effective at spontaneously synthesizing what I'm thinking in feeling in conversations, meetings, etc.

In this way, I think I'm starting to feel more confident in my ability to improvise.
