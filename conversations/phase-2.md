description: Summary of the conversations the tappable prototype inspired.

# Phase #2

During the winter of 2022, [David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I made a tappable prototype so that people could experience and react to the ideas and assumptions latent within [the narrative](../app.md) that is informing the shape and functionality [the app](../app.md) takes on.

21 people to tried the prototype in conversations that invited them to:

1. Imagine themselves within 8 scenarios related to each of [the method's steps](../method.md)
2. Use the tappable prototype to “act out” something in response to each scenario
3. Narrate the feelings, questions, ideas, uncertainties, etc. that emerged in their minds as they did "1." and "2."

These conversations were oriented around learning and deciding:

1. **Learning**: _Do people see/feel/imagine themselves using this app within their current everyday lives?_
2. **Deciding**: _Will I continue investing time, and perhaps money, into turning this prototype into an app we can all use?_

What follows are the key findings these conversations surfaced.

## Findings

#### 1. Customization is crucial

Some people appreciated how the interface appeared in grayscale. Some people were interested in being able to set a different color scheme.

Some people found the font legible. Some people found it felt too formal.

Also, consensuses did not emerge in various places. Like what might be more intuitive ways to name the `Say more` and `Favorite` buttons or what lenses people consider to be more useful than others.

Common among the above is the importance of acknowledging that what people need to feel at ease and empowered to journal varies.&#x20;

As such, the app needs to offer people the ability to synchronize how the app looks, feels, and functions with the personal sensibilities they've developed.

#### 2. Reinforce relationship building

> _What happens if you noticing yourself using the app to capture ideas/thoughts/questions/etc. relevant to something specific you are trying to make, do, or otherwise express?_&#x20;

People asked versions of the above throughout the prototype conversations. And while I'm not yet sure how the app might enable you to represent these relationship(s), I think it's important to make an explicit choice here. Reason: failing to make an explicit choice would mean _not_ considering the impact on people who I think might resort to feeling like they would need to "hold" these relationships themselves or store them elsewhere and therefore limiting their capacity to sense-making.&#x20;

#### 3. Meaning making happens over time

#### Time feels natural

The prototype is opinionated about defaulting to organizing thoughts by time.

People found navigating thoughts this way to be intuitive and relatively unremarkable.

#### Embrace "journaling"

Coming into these conversations, I hadn't developed a practice of using the word "journal" / "journaling" to describe the app and method.

Leaving these conversations, it became clear that "journaling" is  what this is.

This adjustment in language feels significant in that it continues to be a reminder to:

1. Ensure the method and app meets people where they are
2. Embrace, share, and [feel at home](https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/#3-january-2023) in my own story&#x20;

#### Keep things snappy and simple

#### Prompts are curious

#### Make many doorways

#### Consider color

#### Be a good neighbor







#### Overall

#### Actions

_What about the design needs to evolve?_

#### Conviction

_What became **more** clear?_

#### Curiosity

_What became **less** clear?_

#### Open

_What new questions emerged?_
