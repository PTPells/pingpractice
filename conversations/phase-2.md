# Phase #2

During the winter of 2022, [David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I made a tappable prototype so that people could experience and react to the ideas and assumptions latent within [the narrative](../app.md) that is informing the shape and functionality [the app](../app.md) takes on.

21 people to tried the prototype in conversations that invited them to:

1. Imagine themselves within 8 scenarios related to each of [the method's steps](../method.md)
2. Use the tappable prototype to “act out” something in response to each scenario
3. Narrate the feelings, questions, ideas, uncertainties, etc. that emerged in their minds as they did "1." and "2."

These conversations were oriented around learning and deciding:

1. **Learning**: _Do people see/feel/imagine themselves using this app within their current everyday lives?_
2. **Deciding**: _Will I continue investing time, and perhaps money, into turning this prototype into an app we can all use?_

What follows are the key findings these conversations surfaced.

## Findings

#### 1. Customization is crucial

Some people appreciated how the interface appeared in grayscale. Some people were interested in being able to set a different color scheme.

Some people found the font legible. Some people found it felt too formal.

Also, consensuses did not emerge in various places. Like what might be more intuitive ways to name the `Say more` and `Favorite` buttons or what lenses people consider to be more useful than others.

Common among the above is the importance of acknowledging and accepting that what people need to feel at ease and empowered to journal varies.&#x20;

As such, the app needs to offer people the ability to synchronize how the app looks, feels, and functions with the sensibilities they've developed.

#### 2. Meaning making happens over time

#### 3. Time feels natural

#### 4. Embrace "journaling"

#### 5. Keep things snappy and simple

#### 6. Prompts are curious

#### 7. Make many doorways

#### 8. Consider color

#### 9. Reinforce relationship building

#### 10. Be a good neighbor
