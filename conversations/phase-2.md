# Phase #2

During the winter of 2022, [David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I made a tappable prototype so that people could experience and react to the ideas and assumptions latent within [the narrative](../app.md) that is informing [the shape and functionality](../app.md) this tool takes on.

21 people to tried the prototype in conversations that invited them to:

1. Imagine themselves within 8 scenarios related to each of [the method's steps](../method.md)
2. Use the tappable prototype to “act out” something in response to each scenario
3. Narrate the feelings, questions, ideas, uncertainties, etc. that emerged in their minds as they did "1." and "2."

These conversations were oriented around learning and deciding:

1. **Learning**: _Do people see/feel/imagine themselves using this app within their current everyday lives?_
2. **Deciding**: _Will I continue investing time, and perhaps money, into turning this prototype into an app we can all use?_

What follows are the key findings these conversations surfaced.

## Findings

#### Overall

#### Actions

_What about the design needs to evolve?_

#### Conviction

_What became **more** clear?_

#### Curiosity

_What became **less** clear?_

#### Open

_What new questions emerged?_
