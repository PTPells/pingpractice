# Phase #2

During the winter of 2022, [David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I made a tappable prototype to make it a bit easer for people to experience and react to the ideas and assumptions latent within [the narrative](../app.md) that continues to inform the shape and functionality this tool takes on.

21 people to tried the prototype in conversations that invited people to:

1. Imagine themselves within 8 scenarios&#x20;
2. Use the tappable prototype to “act out” something in response to each scenario
3. Narrate the feelings, questions, ideas, uncertainties, etc. that emerged in their minds as they did "1." and "2."

These conversations were oriented around learning and deciding:

1. **Learning**: _Do people see/feel/imagine themselves using this app within their current everyday lives?_
2. **Deciding**: _Will I continue investing time, and perhaps money, into turning this prototype into an app we can all use?_

What follows are the key findings that these conversations surfaced.
