# Conversations

At various moments throughout this exploration, ideas, hypotheses, designs will assume a form that _**appears**_ simultaneously:

1. Stable and solid enough to build upon&#x20;
2. Definitive and clear enough for other people to react to

This page offers an overview of the conversations I've hosted/led/facilitated/convened around these "moments."

## [phase-1.md](phase-1.md "mention")

Between August 2021 and August 2022, I talked with \~30 people who I knew to be intentional and creative.&#x20;

I was motivated to develop a sense for whether the [need I had noticed](../need-memory.md) was a need other people experienced as well. This way, we ([David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I) could gauge the [the solution's ](../app.md)potential appeal and decide whether the need was a stable/durable enough reference point to orient the design of the app around.
