# Conversations

At various moments throughout this exploration, ideas, hypotheses, designs will assume a form that _**appears**_ simultaneously:

1. Stable and solid enough to build upon&#x20;
2. Definitive and clear enough for other people to react to

This page offers an overview of the conversations I've hosted/led/facilitated/convened around these "moments."&#x20;

## [phase-2.md](phase-2.md "mention")

During the winter of 2022, [David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I brought the network of ideas [the app](../app.md) into a shape people could observe and experience by creating a tappable prototype.\
\
To decide whether we would continue investing time and energy into making the app a reality, I hosted a series of conversations as a way to explore/answer the following question:

> _Do people see/feel/imagine themselves using this app within their current, everyday lives alongside everything else they were doing and needing/wanting to do?_



### [phase-1.md](phase-1.md "mention")

Between **August 2021** and **August 2022**, I talked with \~30 people who I knew to be intentional and creative.&#x20;

I was motivated to develop a sense for whether the [need I had noticed](../need-memory.md) was a need other people experienced as well. This way, we ([David](https://www.davidgoligorsky.com/index.html) and I) could gauge the [the solution's ](../app.md)potential appeal and decide whether the need was a stable/durable enough reference point to orient the design of the app around.
