description: Experimenting with new ways to revisit Pings

# Experiment/Twitter + Database

{% hint style="info" %}
This experiment started on 10 April 2023.
{% endhint %}

The [Twitter experiment](experiment-twitter.md) proved successful in so far as the behavior it was intended to help me evaluate ‚Äì [noticing and naming Pings](method.md) ‚Äì [stuck](experiment-twitter.md#impact-and-conclusions). At the time of writing (23 April 2023), I've jotted down 2,300+ Pings and I continue doing so most days.

[Motived to experiment](experiment-twitter.md#impact-and-conclusions) with ways to simulate the serendipitous revisiting and discovery [the app describes](app.md) and prompted by a conversation with [Prateek](https://prtksxna.com/), this experiment is an effort to prototype a distinct place I can go to revisit and discover past Pings.\

I'm starting to use the "Pin" field I set up yesterday which in turn inspired me to add an image today. Cool!

#### 26 April

Added a "Pin" field that I'm thinking I can use to mark and quickly return to thoughts I want to more easily revisit.

_Dashboard_

Woah!&#x20;

Now that I've got this dashboard set up, I'm immediately curious to see how - if at all ‚Äì this view provides me a lens through which to look at, and engage with, this Ping Practice.



_Adding meaning to "Favoriting"_

Discovering that Airtable makes it possible to associate an image with a record (or in this context, a Ping), is helping me to imagine a new potential choice to consider when revisiting: looking out for Pings that feel especially resonant so that I can consider elevating them in some way (e.g. associating an image, or other types of media) to deepen/enhance/extend the meaning/message of the Ping and my ability to remember that meaning/message.

_Note: the above was prompted by me experimenting with setting up a "Dashboard" for the base I set up in Airtable. In doing so, I thought "Oh, it might be interesting to visualize how many Pings I've 'Favorited'."_

#### 12 April: Search

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Just now, I was [saying something in @pingpractice](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1646205350817955843?s=20). In the process, I noticed myself making a choice _not_ to use a possessive pronoun.  In making this choice, I thought to myself, "Oh this would be a good convention/pattern to name in the ["Personal syntax" are.na channel](https://www.are.na/peter-pelberg/personal-syntax) I started."

Next, I opened up are.na and I started [drafting this block](https://www.are.na/block/21361463) to describe/bring shape to this convention. A few moments in, I noticed myself getting stuck, not locating the words I felt like I needed to express the idea that prompted me to visit are.na in the first place.

_"Hmm, what to do now?"_ I thought and then realized, _"Oh, I've "pinged" (trying out this language) about this before."_

I then went to Notion to search for `pronoun` which quickly returned what I've said in the past about possessive pronouns and ultimately helped me arrive at the language I needed!

Before Monday, I would've gone directly to Twitter to attempt the search above which  past experiences have led me to doubt whether that search would return the Tweets I'm fairly certain existed.

#### 11 April: Day/time lens/filter

I finished [this past Monday (10 April) feeling](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1645606642724261888?s=20) similar to how I remember myself [feeling the Monday before (3 April)](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1643057038199787520).

This led me to experience, and subsequently [develop a bit more conviction around](https://twitter.com/pingpractice/status/1645606642724261888), the utility of  [the app](app.md) offering people an easy way to see what they've said on days/time that are similar to the moments they currently find themselves to be in and/or curious about.

In response, I created a new view within Notion that enables me to easily [see what I've said "on this day" across time](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

[^1]: Observations and updates

[^2]: Ideally, the app will automatically know what day it is and surface relevant thoughts accordingly. Although, with this current set up in Notion, I'm still needing to manually input what day(s) of the week I'd like to see thoughts from.
