"Ping Practice" is a working name.

Ping Practice is a bit like "Apple Photos or Google Photos for your thoughts."&#x20;

The app combines a way to quickly capture tiny thoughts with a “for you” page that resurfaces these thoughts at a later time so that you can make sense of them.

“Sense” that could take the form of a:

* _Name to order a series of observations_
* _Next step to experiment with_
* _Need that might explain a pattern of reactions_
* _Value that is important to you_
* _Question that helps you focus_
* _Affirmation that empowers you_
* _Reminder that helps you stay on track and keep going_
* _etc._

Ping Practice is built on [a methodology for turning everyday awareness into insights](https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/ping-practice). Ping assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues. Clues whose meaning gets unlocked through:

1. Noticing&#x20;
2. Naming&#x20;
3. Revisiting&#x20;
4. Engaging
5. Remembering&#x20;
6. Applying

Over the past five years, I've [experimented with various tools and workflows](https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/about) that have helped me converge on this method and more recently, become clear about [the need for it to be more accessible](https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/need-memory).

Ping Practice is an experiment to bring steps that have been spread across different apps, notebooks, text files, post-it notes, and 3x5 cards into a cohesive flow that feels simple, snappy, configurable, and small enough to be useful without having to think about.

Ping Practice is trying to help you develop a practice of “connecting the dots” and acting on the insights you converge on.
