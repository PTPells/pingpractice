### Motivation&#x20;

The [DailyNotes experiment](experiment-dailynotes.md) led me to see [improving my memory and recall](need-memory.md) as core to helping me evolve past reflexes that were no longer useful to me.&#x20;

Drawing inspiration from flash cards, [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced\_repetition), and [lateral thinking techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral\_thinking) (namely [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique\_Strategies)) I sought to come up with a flow that would enable me to quickly create and revisit digital cards.

The intention I had here was to:

1. Keep the things I was working on and towards present in my mind throughout the day _and_
2. Make it easy for me to "reach" for a stock of strategies (read: quotes I found inspirational, things I thought to be true, etc.) I could use in moments where I felt faced with a choice that would could bring me in or out of alignment with how I was trying to be and what I was trying to do.
