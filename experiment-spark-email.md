# Experiment: Spark Email



{% hint style="success" %}
This experiment started on 6 Sep 2021 and concluded on 8 December 2021.
{% endhint %}

This was an experiment to simulate the "quick capture" and "revisit" experience I had been imagining for [the app](app.md) by stringing existing tools together into a workflow that felt somewhat cogent.

The goals here being to learn:

1. _What did I notice myself doing/needing after having a reasonable "stock" of cards?_
2. _What – if anything – might I need develop a habit of making cards?_
3. _What would I write cards about and what form(s) would cards take?_

### Impact & Conclusions

### Motivation&#x20;

The [DailyNotes experiment](experiment-dailynotes.md) led me to see [improving my memory and recall](need-memory.md) as core to helping me evolve past reflexes that were no longer useful to me.&#x20;

Drawing inspiration from flash cards, [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced\_repetition), and [lateral thinking techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral\_thinking) (namely [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique\_Strategies)) I sought to come up with a flow that would enable me to quickly create and revisit digital cards.

The intention I had here was to:

1. Keep [the things I was working on and towards](experiment-weeklynotes.md) present in my mind throughout the day _and_
2. Make it easy for me to "reach" for a stock of strategies (read: quotes I found inspirational, things I thought to be true, etc.) I could use in moments where I felt faced with a choice that would could bring me in or out of alignment with how I was trying to be and what I was trying to do.

### Details

I used two iOS apps for this experiment:

1. [Paper Plane](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paper-plane-email/id1486124719) for quickly getting down resonant thoughts so that I could explore and refine them at a later time using the Spark Mail app. \[i]&#x20;
2. [Spark Mail](https://sparkmailapp.com/) for receiving the emails I sent to myself using Paper Plane.\[ii]&#x20;

_i. I considered using_ [_Drafts_](https://paperplane.williamhockey.com/) _instead of Paper Plane because of the edit history and metadata Drafts exposes about each draft you create. Although, I decided against using it because the actual input didn't feel quite like how I imagine the cards input to feel: fast, simple, and detached from the future._

_ii. I set up a new, dedicated email account for receiving the thoughts I was jotting down with Paper Plane so as not to muddle this experience with the existing email workflows and habits I'd established._
