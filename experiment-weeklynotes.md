# Experiment: WeeklyNotes

{% hint style="success" %}
This experiment is complete. It clarified for me the power in compressing intentions into succinct and inspiring phrases.
{% endhint %}

### Description

The [DailyNotes Experiment](experiment-dailynotes.md) helped me to become clear about [needing a way to remember](need-memory.md) how I wanted to be and what I wanted to be working towards.

To hold myself accountable to articulating a set of intentions and to make it easier for me to remember them, I created a new page called WeeklyNotes. This was the single place where I would write and iterate on the intentions I was trying to keep top of mind for me during a given week.

To start, the note lived within Dropbox in a file called `WeeklyNotes.md.`&#x20;

### Impact & Conclusions

The WeeklyNotes experiment helped me to see the power in compressing how I wanted to be and what I wanted to be working towards into a few succinct and inspiring set of phrases.

Doing the above helped me to actually remember what I was wanting to work on and towards. It felt like these guides were within reach in the moments where I had opportunities to apply them. In a way, it felt like these guides were opening up a new set of choices for me to consider in situations where I had become used to thinking and acting in a limited set of ways.

I'm not sure I would have arrived at this new format had I not noticed 12 weeks into the experiment that I wasn't revisiting the WeeklyNotes throughout the week. I would come back to the page on Sunday when it was time to reflect, but seldom beyond that. The lack of revisitation combined with the prose-like reflections led the intentions I'd set for myself to quickly fade from my mind once the week got going.

### Details

To hold myself accountable to articulating a set of intentions and to make it easier for me to remember them, I created a page called `WeeklyNotes.md.`&#x20;

This was the single place where I would write and iterate on the intentions I was trying to keep top of mind for me during a given week.

This practice started as a single file in Dropbox. At the top of this text file was its purpose:

And then within the WeeklyNotes page were headings for each week, with the most recent week at the top:

For the first 8 weeks or so of the experiment, I was relatively loose with what I considered an "intention." Many of these early weeks ended up being more reflections than concise intentions per se. Regardless of the form, I was articulating the themes I thought were important for me to focus on in the given week.&#x20;

The process for writing these intentions typically went as follows...

On Sunday, I would revisit the WeeklyNotes note and reflect on how I thought the past week had gone, often revisiting the DailyNotes I'd written as prompts to get me thinking.&#x20;

I would then write a few sentences about how I wanted to show up in the week ahead and that was it.

In April 2020, 12 weeks into the experiment, I shifted the format of the WeeklyNotes page (now "Weekly Notes" as I'd started experimenting with Roam Research by this point). Rather than creating new sections for each week, I simplified things. There were now two headings that would remain constant:

* `Generative rules: constraints to guide growth`&#x20;
* `Objectives: what am I trying to accomplish?`

Each Sunday, I was still reflecting on the week that had just passed and thinking about the intentions I wanted to carry with me for the week ahead. Although,  now I started writing more concise and actionable intentions and objectives and accompanying the former with quotes that inspired me to "move" in these new ways:
