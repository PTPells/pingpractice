# Need: Memory

### Need

Hypothesis I will be able unblock myself and act in ways that align with how I want to evolve if I was able to: A) recognize myself as being stuck/blocked in the moments I am feeling this way and B) remember why “past Peter” decided it was important to avoid falling back on outdated habits so.

### Hypothesis

I will be able unblock myself and act in ways that align with how I want to evolve if I was able to:&#x20;

* Recognize myself as being stuck/blocked in the moments I am feeling this way _and_
* Remember why “past Peter” decided it was important to avoid falling back on outdated habits so.

### Motivation

The [DailyNotes experiment](experiment-dailynotes.md) was successful in so far as it helped me to develop a consistent writing practice and through it, identify things I thought to be true.

Although, the experiment left me with an unmet need. I wasn’t remembering these truths and my voice in the situations when I needed them most: the tiny, fast, reflexive moments in my everyday life where there were fleeting opportunities for me to put them into practice, to move in new ways, to make different choices instead of getting stuck in habits/ways of thinking that were no longer useful to me, and ultimately, to learn and evolve.

The above became clear to me in the summer of 2021. I was feeling: Angry when I would see other people publicly exploring ideas and think about all of the times that I’d been too afraid to do the same. Afraid of a future where I felt regret for not having overcome the insecurity and self-doubt that kept me small and afraid of “speaking up.”

I brought language to these feelings and this need in a moment where I had become confident I was capable of evolving when certain conditions were met, clear enough about what I thought those conditions were, and motivated by the prospect of a future where I felt lighter and more open to uncertainty.

With the above in place, I began experimenting with solutions.
