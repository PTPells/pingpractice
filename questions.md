# Questions

Questions are important to me.&#x20;

I use questions as navigational instruments to:

* Explore ideas
* Compress what I've learned into actionable reminders
* Create spaces to meet other people in
* Reveal relationships that could explain recurrent reactions
* Reflect on where I've been so that I can better understand where I am now and where I might go next

I have found that while some questions can create opportunity and openness, others can evaporate momentum and promote closure.

This page is an effort to name the underlying patterns the produce questions that lead me to feel closer to myself, other people, and the environments we share.&#x20;

NOTE: I have not yet formulated an opinion about the dinstinction(s) between "questions" and "prompts." Although, in the meantime, I'm going to use to the term "question" to refer to any request for information. Whereas I'm going to use the term "prompt" to refer to questions intended for use in a particular context or to elicit a particular kind of interaction or reaction.&#x20;

### Prompts for Journaling/Reflecting

* Question should be something you can immediately start answering
* Question should use language that feels natural and intrinsic to you
* Question should invite you to look at something that is familiar and you can see vividly through a lens that feels fresh

### Prompts For Becoming Present With Other People

* The person asking needs to be curious in the answer
* Question should not lead the people responding to trade or compare answers in ways that feel zero-sum
* Question should not require the other person to compress or make sense of something new within the same moment they are being asked to do so
* Question should pull people into the moment they are all present within&#x20;
* Question should demonstrate an awareness for what the person is likely to already have/be thinking about
* Questions should, ideally, be soemthing the other person would be energized to answer if asked
