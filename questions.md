# Questions

Questions are important to me.&#x20;

I use questions as navigational instruments to:

* Explore ideas
* Compress what I've learned into actionable reminders
* Create spaces to meet other people in
* Reveal relationships that could explain recurrent reactions
* Reflect on where I've been so that I can better understand where I am now and where I might go next

I have found that while some questions can create opportunity and openness, others can evaporate momentum and promote closure.

This page is an effort to name the underlying patterns the produce questions that create and open spaces.
